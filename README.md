# React Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe game built with React, developed as part of my learning journey through Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's online React course. This project showcases the implementation of various React best practices and concepts that are crucial for building efficient React applications.

## Key Features:
### React Best Practices: 
Implements essential React patterns recommended by experts to ensure code scalability and maintainability.
### Lifting State Up:
Demonstrates the technique of lifting the state up among components to facilitate better state management across the application.
### State Management:
Utilizes React's state management capabilities to handle the game's state throughout the gameplay.
### Component Splitting:
Organizes the UI into manageable, reusable components using props to handle data and callbacks effectively.

## Learning Outcomes:
This project not only helped solidify my understanding of React's core principles but also provided hands-on experience in managing complex states and structuring applications for real-world scenarios.
